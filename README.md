## Link Vault: Save Links on the Go

**A browser extension I made to learn JavaScript fundamentals**

## Use Cases

1. Most **sales represantatives** use excel sheets to keep track of their leads and prospects, and they open it maybe once a day to update it. But if they come across a lead while browsing LinkedIn leisurely, they laze out and don't update the excel sheet, potentially lose out on great prospects. This extension helps them save links/profiles on the go. Just one click, and it's done!

2. Have a lot of folders and bookmarks in your bookmark bar and still come across a link that you have no idea where to put? Forget the internal deliberation to decide where to put it. Save it here and keep the organising for another time.
